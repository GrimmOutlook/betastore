Why can't I change the name of 'gh-pages' to something more project-related?

Why can't I make the master branch my default branch instead of gh-pages?

I have made a bunch of commits, so why don't they show up in my 'Your Contributions' part of my profile?

Why has GitHub customer service repeatedly ignored me when I ask them these questions?
